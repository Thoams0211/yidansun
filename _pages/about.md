Hi, I'm Yidan Sun, a master student in School of Software Engineering at Zhejiang University.


I studied at the School of Software, Nankai University from 2021 to 2025 and obtained a bachelor's degree. During this time, I conducted research in the [AIOPS Lab](https://nkcs.iops.ai) under the guidance of [Prof. Shenglin Zhang](https://nkcs.iops.ai/zhangshenglin/).

I am advised by [Mengying Zhu](https://person.zju.edu.cn/NB23086) of Zhejiang University and my research interests include Large Language Models (LLMs) and representation learning.
